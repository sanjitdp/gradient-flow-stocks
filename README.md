# gradient-flow-stocks
This repository contains code implementing a novel Wasserstein gradient flow model for stock return prediction. We test our algorithm on a dataset obtained from Trexquant (https://trexquant.com). This is my final project for 10-716 (Advanced Machine Learning) at Carnegie Mellon University.
